			<h2>Subtheme: Corporate Landlords & Evictions</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<p>When starting this assignment, I decided to begin by framing my work into three "big questions" and with subcategories that I could delve further into. These questions were written without any knowledge of what the dataset looked like, which is something that I might change about my process in the future. These three big questions were:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Who is getting evicted?</li>
				<li>Who is doing the evictions?</li>
				<li>Where are evictions happening?</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For my first question, I wanted to look more specifically into the range and number of household incomes, racial demographics, and age ranges. The "Housing Justice
				Beyond the Emergency" readings establishes that communities of color and single mothers are most vulnerable to evictions, and I wanted to examine the dataset to visualize that
			</p>
			<p>For my second question, I wanted to understand the effects of private equity and corporate Landlords, because I was first introduced to these concepts during the readings for A1 (When Private Equity Becomes Your Landlord)
			</p>
			<p>For my third question, I wanted to approach the dataset with a more spatial lens, overlaying eviction locations with any spatial data that exists on the information in questions 1 and 2
				I believe that this might provide insights that numbers alone won't be able to show.
